# Notes 20.11.2022

Learned Datagrip how to import our CSV.

1. Add traktor.internet-box.ch as a database source
2. Created 2 Databases: Project and Integrated
3. Imported the 3 CSV with semicolon separation and first row as headers.
4. Problem with naming convention as multiple coloums had the same name. Needed some small refactoring.
5. Problem with importing: data source lost connection. 
6. Added 'Fun queries.sql'
7. Merged the two big datasets

## TODO
- Check if all data is imported correctly


## TODO EDI
- Change the secure priv options.
